# static 

- The static keyword defines a static method or field for a class, or a static initialization block. Static properties cannot be directly accessed on instances of the class. Instead, they're accessed on the class itself

```js
class Chameleon {
  static colorChange(newColor) {
    this.newColor = newColor;
    return this.newColor;
  }

  constructor({ newColor = 'green' } = {}) {
    this.newColor = newColor;
  }
}

const freddie = new Chameleon({ newColor: 'purple' });
console.log(freddie.colorChange('orange'));

```

- `A`: orange
- `B`: purple
- `C`: green
- `D`: TypeError

#### Answer: D

The `colorChange` function is static. Static methods are designed to live only on the constructor in which they are created, and cannot be passed down to any children or called upon class instances. Since `freddie` is an instance of class Chameleon, the function cannot be called upon it. A `TypeError` is thrown.
